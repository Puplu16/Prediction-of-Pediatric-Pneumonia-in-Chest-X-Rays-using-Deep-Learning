# Prediction-of-Pediatric-Pneumonia-in-Chest-X-Rays-using-Deep-Learning
This project develops a deep learning model to automatically detect pediatric pneumonia from chest X-rays. Using CNNs like ResNet and DenseNet, it classifies images to support rapid diagnosis in low-resource settings. The pipeline includes preprocessing, model training, and Grad-CAM heatmaps for interpretable results.
